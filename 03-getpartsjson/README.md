1. Include **axios** to your `index.html`

2. Add in a button which when you click on it, it will load the following JSON:

3. Display **only** the first name, last name and the different parts of address in `<body>` when the button is pressed. Your output should look something like this:


<ul>
  <li>First Name: Rack</li>
  <li>Last Name: Jackon</li>
  <li>Street Address: 126</li>
  <li>City: San Jone</li>
  <li>State: CA</li>
  <li>Postal Code: 394221</li>
</ul>
